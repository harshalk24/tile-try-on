# Room Renders Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the room_renders directory.

To add your own room images:

1. Add your room image files to this directory with these exact names:
   - modern-living-room.jpg
   - cozy-bedroom.jpg
   - kitchen-space.jpg
   - bathroom-design.jpg

2. Or update the roomRenders array in src/components/UploadArea.tsx to match your file names

3. The images should be:
   - JPG or PNG format
   - At least 400x300 pixels
   - Under 2MB each
   - Clear, well-lit room photos

The component will show a fallback placeholder for any missing images.
